My To-Do List App
This is a responsive, theme-aware to-do list application built as part of my front-end portfolio. The goal of this project was to demonstrate clean UI design, modular CSS architecture, and accessible markup using semantic HTML and vanilla JavaScript.

Overview
The app allows users to manage tasks across multiple categories with a streamlined interface optimized for both desktop and mobile. It includes dark mode support, animated task rendering, and a sticky footer for mobile task entry.

Features
Category-based task organization (Work, Personal, Urgent)
Add, edit, delete, and complete tasks
Dark mode toggle with smooth transitions
Responsive layout with mobile-first design
Sticky footer for quick task input on mobile
Accessible form controls using ARIA attributes
Animated task rendering and highlight effects
Modular CSS using custom properties and layout utilities

Technologies
HTML5
CSS3 (custom properties, flexbox, grid)
JavaScript
Google Fonts
GitHub Pages for deployment

File Structure
index.html — semantic structure and responsive layout
style.css — fully annotated stylesheet with theme support
script.js — task logic, DOM rendering, and event handling

Design Notes
The interface was designed to be minimal, readable, and intuitive. I used a utility-first approach to CSS with custom properties for consistent spacing, color, and transitions. The layout adapts fluidly across screen sizes, and the codebase is structured for maintainability and clarity.
